  The codes which follow reflect an original abridgment and correction
  of the data presented in "The Analytical Greek Lexicon" (London:
  Samuel Bagster and Sons, 1859).
<p>
  Comparison also has been made against the revised updating of that
  lexicon by Wesley J. Perschbacher in his "The New Analytical Greek
  Lexicon" (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1990). The Perschbacher revision
  failed to adjust over 500 parsing or declensional errors in the
  original Bagster edition; these now have been corrected.
<p>
  The abbreviation system was developed independently. Its features are
  similar to those in Timothy and Barbara Friberg "The Analytical Greek
  New Testament" (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1981), and can be used readily
  by anyone familiar with the Bagster lexicon, Perschbacher, or
  Friberg.
<p>
  Many Greek New Testament non-verbal forms (nouns, adjectives,
  conjunctions, prepositions, and particles) can be interpreted in more
  than one way. The declensions presented reflect a normal
  interpretation of those forms which actually occur in the Greek New
  Testament. Every NT occurrence is covered, and the declensions
  reflect the totality of Greek NT non-verbal forms.
<p>
  The data presented are not claimed to be free from error; the editor
  may be notified of any problem regarding the parsing, declension, or
  Strong's number assigned to any word, at SEBTS, P. O. Box 1889, Wake
  Forest, NC 27588.

      -ATT  = ATTic Greek form
</pre>

<h4>  STRONG'S NUMBERS:</h4>
<p>
    To access the lexical root form definition of any Greek word, the
    appropriate Strong's concordance number immediately follows each
    Greek word. The definition then can be obtained by the normal
    routine for definitions as used for English texts.
<p>
    The Strong's numbers used for the Greek New Testament do NOT always
    coincide with those used in the English texts. Strong clearly
    assisted the lay reader of the Authorized Version by assigning
    numbers to each unique root word form; however, he also attempted
    further to aid the reader by subdividing some root forms into
    separately numbered entries.
<p>
    The result of such subdivision can be seen in the multiple forms of
    the verb "to be" (each of which ultimately derives from Strong's
    1510). The same policy of separate numerical entries also was
    applied to various comparative and superlative forms of some
    adjectives and adverbs, as well as to the adverbial use of some
    noun forms.
<p>
    Conversely, rather than treating each word separately (as would
    have been proper for anyone able to read the Greek), Strong
    assigned a single unique number to certain multiple-word
    expressions (e.g., "ou mh" or "ei de mhge"). This number no longer
    was reflective of the individual root forms. Once more, this action
    was taken by Strong in order to assist the lay English reader who
    knew no Greek; in practice this policy becomes a severe hindrance
    to those who know and seek to read and understand the New Testament
    in its original Koine Greek.
<p>
    Thus, the Strong's numbers -- well-suited as they may be for the
    lay reader of the English text -- in places become confusing and
    detrimental to those reading the Greek New Testament who would use
    those numbers when searching for or classifying the ultimate
    lexical root forms of various Greek words.
<p>
    The present Greek edition attempts to alter Strong's Greek word
    numbers so that they relate directly to their ultimate practical
    root form. For example, all forms of the irregular second aorist
    root "eipon" (Strong's 2036) now are assigned to the root "legw"
    (Strong's 3004), to which "eipon" functions as the practical
    aorist. Similarly, all derived forms of "eidon" (originally
    included within Strong's 1492) now are related appropriately to
    either "oraw" (Strong's 3708) or "oida" (Strong's 1492), in
    accordance with their particular meaning.
<p>
    In some cases, new words exist within the Koine Greek text that had
    not appeared in the Textus Receptus upon which Strong's numbering
    system had been based. In such cases, the new word is located
    either under a relatively appropriate Strong's number, or has been
    assigned a Strong's number that otherwise would no longer exist,
    due to consolidation under the root lexical forms. One case in
    particular is that of "ekperissou" and "ekperisswv," neither of
    which exist separately in the TR: these have been assigned the
    (otherwise now vacant) Strong's number 4055, thus retaining a
    single common root, and that in close relation to other words
    containing some form of "periss-".
<p>
    The revision of the Strong's numbers within the Greek NT text is an
    ongoing process. Ultimately all Strong's numbers in the Greek text
    will agree with the Greek lexical root form.


<h4>  ADDITIONAL NOTES:</h4>
<p>
    It is ASSUMED that all Strong's numbers are correct; these have not
    been verified, although a few errors have been noted and corrected.
<p>
    Declined proper nouns are not specifically identified as being
    names of persons or places; only indeclinable forms are so
    identified.
<p>
    Reflexive pronouns have the Person (1,2,3) attached, e.g. F-3DSF
    See "auth" in the Bagster lexicon or Perschbacher for further
    examples.

  The abbreviations which pertain to each of these categories are the

    Tense: P          = Present
           I          = Imperfect
           F          = Future             Second Future     = 2F

           P          = Participle

    Extra: -ATT       = Attic Greek form

    Person: 1, 2, 3   = First, Second, Third person

    Number: S, P      = Singular, Plural

    Gender: M, F, N   = Masculine, Feminine, Neuter

    Case:  N          = Nominative      (5-case system only!)

<p>
    SPECIAL NOTE: the so-called "Second" forms of the Aorist, Future,
    Perfect and Pluperfect are respectively designated as 2A, 2F, 2P
    and 2L, preceding the voice and mood designations. Functionally,
    these forms are equivalent to the undesignated (First) Aorist,
    Future, Perfect, and Pluperfect forms.

   <h4>                     ADDITIONAL NOTES</h4>

<h4>  ACCURACY OF STRONG'S NUMBERS:</h4>
<p>
    It is ASSUMED that all Strong's numbers are correct; these have not
    been verified, although a few errors have been noted and corrected.

<h4>  THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE VERB "TO BE":</h4>
<p>
    Although the analytical lexicons state no voice for the various
    forms of "to be" (including compound verbs in which "-eimi" is an
    element), for the purposes of the current parsing data ALL such
    forms are considered to be in the ACTIVE voice.
<p>
    In addition, Strong's Concordance gives unique numbers to many
    separate forms of the verb "to be", even though all these properly
    derive from "eimi" (1510) alone. Perschbacher gives both numbers:
    the particular Strong's number in the left margin and the root
    number 1510 in the right margin. In the present electronic Greek NT
    texts, ALL forms of "eimi" reflect the single number 1510.
<p>
    Since accents and breathings are not provided in these Greek texts,
    some word forms will appear identical although possessing distinct
    parsings or declensions. The following specifically should be
    noted:
<blockquote>
      The form "h" occurs infrequently as part of the verb "to be"
      (V-PAS-3S of 1510, numbered 5600 by Strong); the same form
      reflecting the definite article (3588), relative pronoun (3739),
      and disjunctive particle (2228, 2229) dominates within the Greek
      NT.
</blockquote><blockquote>
      The form "ei" also occurs infrequently as part of the verb "to
      be" (V-PAI-2S of 1510, numbered 1488 by Strong); the same form
      (in the absence of accents and breathings) occurs most frequently
      as a conditional particle (1487).
</blockquote><blockquote>
      The form "hn" is frequent as a verb form in the Greek NT
      (V-IAI-3S of 1510, numbered 2258 by Strong); it also occurs
      frequently as a relative pronoun (3739).
</blockquote><blockquote>
      The subjunctive verb form "wsin" (V-PAS-3P of 1510) is
      incorrectly cited by Strong as participial (5607). Note also that
      the same form may be a plural noun from 3775.
</blockquote><blockquote>
      The verb form "hv" can be either a present subjunctive (PAS-2S,
      Strong 1510) or an imperfect indicative (V-IAI-2S, Strong 2229).
      Both forms derive from the root 1510; the parsing information
      following each form makes the distinction clear.
