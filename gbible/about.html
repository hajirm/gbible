    <h2>How to use the Greek Interlinear Bible</h2>
    <p>You can think of this application in much the same way as a book -- that is, there are books, chapters, and pages,
       and you can highlight verses, add annotations, and add bookmarks.</p>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>To go from page to page in the Bible, search results, or Strong's Lookup results, just swipe left to go to the
       next page, and right to go to the previous page.</p>
    <p>To go to another location (book, chapter, bookmark, etc.), open the left-side menu. You can do this by clicking on the button at
       the upper-left corner of the screen, or by swiping from the left side of the screen to the right.</p>
    <p>Once the menu is displayed, you can choose from all the Books and Chapters in the New Testament. To select a Book, 
       click on the Book's name. The available chapters appear from the right. Once you select a chapter, the verse will appear
       from the right. Select a verse to complete navigation.</p>
    <p>You can also navigate to your highlights, annotations and history from the menu. Just press the appropriate button
       at the top of the menu, and then select the item you want to navigate to.</p>
    <p>While the menu will close automatically when you select an item, if you wish to close it manually, press the 
       button in the top-left corner again, or swipe to the right from the left side of your device.</p>
    <h3>Selecting Verses and Managing Highlights and Annotations</h3>
    <p>You can select a verse simply by tapping it. Once tapped, it will turn a light blue color. Any verses you select
       will be used when applying highlights. Annotations will only use the <i>first</i> selected verse.</p>
    <p>To create or remove highlights or annotations, tap-and-hold on a verse. A menu will appear
       giving you the options of highlighting, removing those highlights, and creating or viewing an annotation.</p>
    <p>You can also hold-and-tap on a word to display a menu which can be used to search the Bible for the word,
       to search Strong's for the word, and more.</p>
    <h3>Searching</h3>
    <p>You can search the Bible from the text directly by tapping-and-holding your finger on the word you want to search,
       and then selecting "Search," then "Search Bible..." from the resulting menu. Alternatively, you can use the search tab
       on the bottom of your screen. Just tap it, and then type a word (or words) in the resulting search field. When finished, click the
       "Search" button on the popup keyboard.</p>
    <p>You can search for a Greek word directly, without tapping-and-holding on a word, by typing in a Greek word directly from the device's built-in Greek keyboard.</p>
    <p>The search may take a few seconds to appear. Once it does, it will display the reference(s) where the
       search text was found. To go to the verse, just tap the item.</p>
    <h3>Strong's Lookup</h3>
    <p>You can search Strong's from the text directly by tapping-and-holding your finger on a Strong's G-Number, then
       selecting "Search" then "Search Strong's..." from the resulting menu. You can also search the entire Strong's dictionary
       for any word (or words) by selecting "Strong's Lookup" from the tab bar at the bottom of the screen, and then
       entering your search words in the search field.</p>
    <p>If you tap on a search result item, you'll be taken to a search results page indicating everywhere that G-Number
       is used.</p>
    
    <h3>Morphology</h3>
    <p>Where available, the morphology of the Greek word is displayed in green text. This code describes the type of word,
       the person used (that is, first, second, third person), and various tenses. An exhaustive key of what these mean
       is located at <a target="_blank" href="./parsings.html">http://koti.24.fi/jusalak/GreekNT/PARSINGS.TXT</a>.

<h5>Book &amp; Chapter Counts</h4>
<p>Obtained from http://www.deafmissions.com/tally/bkchptrvrs.html

<h5>Greek NT: Byzantine/Majority Text (2000)</h5>
<p>The Greek New Testament according to the Byzantine Textform, edited by Maurice A. Robinson and William G. Pierpont, 2000 edition This is the edition by Pierpont and Robinson of a Majority, or Byzantine, text of the NT. It is similar to an earlier production of Hodges and Farstad in being based on von Soden's apparatus, but without their stemmatic reconstruction of the Apocalypse and the Pericope Adulterae.

<h5>Greek NT: Tischendorf 8th Ed.</h5>
<p>The Greek Text corresponds to the printed text found in:

<p>Tischendorf, Constantinus, Novum Testamentum Graece, editio octava critica major Vol. I, 1869; Vol. II 1872, Leipzig:Giesecke and Devrient. Vol 3, Prolegomena, ed. by Caspar Rene' Gregory, Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1894.

<p>The text contains no accents or diacritical marks.

<p>This text was prepared from the Westcott-Hort-Nestle Aland text found in the Greek text prepared by Dr. Maurice Robinson. The text was compared to the printed edition of Tischendorf's. Changes were made in the text to make it correspond to the printed edition. The text was proofed against the Tischendorf text.

<p>According to J. Harold Greenlee "His 'eighth major edition' (1869-72) contains a critical apparatus which has never been equaled in comprehensiveness of citation of Greek mss., versions, and patristic evidence. A century later it is still indispensable for serious work in the text of the N.T."

<p>The Greek text is released as a public domain text.

<p>If any errors are found in this text please let me know as soon as possible.
